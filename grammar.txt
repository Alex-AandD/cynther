Getting a taste of cynther

fun main(string s1, int some_int) => int {
    if "hello" == letters && 5 != numbers => x = x + 1; 
    return 
}

    expr := binary | unary | primitive
    
    term := factor "+ | -" factor*
    factor := unary "* | /" unary*
    unary := "-" unary* 
	    | primitive

    primitive:   id
	       | int
	       | string
	       | double
	       | bool
